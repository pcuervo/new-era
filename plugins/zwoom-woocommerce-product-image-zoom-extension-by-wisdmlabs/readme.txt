This plugin allows store visitors on a single product page, to easily zoom into the primary product image within its container.

== Description ==

__ZWoom - WooCommerce Product Image Zoom__ helps your WooCommerce store visitors seamlessly zoom in to a single product image. Zwoom supports only __simple products__ for now.

__The Problem__

Many store visitors are interested in zooming into a product image, to notice the finer details. WooCommerce handles this by displaying a zoomed version of the product image in a fancybox/lightbox, each time a product image or thumbnail is clicked. While this solves the purpose, it is cumbersome for visitors because they have to toggle between the fancybox and the product page to infer details about the product such as price, features, shipping details, etc.

Some WooCommerce websites address this issue partially by displaying a secondary zoomed image box when a visitor hovers over a product image.

We also noticed that some plugins/sites have addressed the issue partially, in the form of creating a secondary image zoom box when you hover over the product image. But the issue with this approach is that the zoomed image box overlaps important product details, or the "Add to Cart" functionality.

So, at WisdmLabs, we decided to address all these issues which culminated into this awesome plugin!

__How Zwoom solves the problem?__

Zwoom displays the zoomed version of the image in its own image box on hover, thus eliminating any overlay issues. It also adds a slider for secondary product images, instead of the multiple rows of images which appear by default. If any of these secondary images are clicked, we load the image in primary image box, rather than directly opening the fancybox (which is the default functionality).

When an image in the primary image box is clicked, the fancybox pop-up is shown to visitors, allowing them to browse all product images.

__How to set the Zoom Level?__

Upon installing and activating the plugin, you will be able to see an additional option in the WooCommerce Catalog Page within WooCommerce settings. The new option will allow you to set the 'Zoom Level' and is present just below the set width and height options for a Single Product Image.

__Please note, the current version of Zwoom is compatible only with WooCommerce 2.4 and above.__
